# The Future of Node.js

> There will be no changes to the module system.  None.  It's finished. - [@izs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/nodejs/9afurRCTlOc/JKVo0ThFZIsJ)

---

> If you want to make exciting dramatic breaking changes to node-core, and you can't find satisfaction by writing userland npm modules, then please fork joyent/node, give it a new name and logo, and go as completely crazy as you want. OSS FTW.

---

> We are done making breaking changes at the Node.js layer.  If your program runs today, we're doing everything we can to make sure that it will run next year, albeit faster and more reliably.
